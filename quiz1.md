Centaurs *are being killed by Hercules*. (Use the present tense)
Centaurs *were being killed by Hercules*. (Use the perfect tense)
Centaurs *were killed by Hercules*. (Use the perfect tense)
When Hercules *killed* the Centaurs, he carried off Deianira. (Emphasize the circumstance, not the timing, of what Hercules did.)
At the moment when Deianira *saw* Hercules’ garment burst into flames, she realized the Centaur had lied to her.
Hercules *led* Deianira in marriage (i.e., he married her).
Hercules repeatedly *asked* Eurytus for permission to marry Iole
