Option B
Compare a passage of Hyginus with an illutration of the same subject in art. Identify the work of art, and cite at least two specific points in Hyginusâ€™ Latin that are similar to or different from the visual illustration.

The passage of Hyginus, and the illustration I chose to discuss is from Chapter 30, section 1. When you first look at the statue, you see a small boy holding a snake with one hand. The passage reads "Infans cum esset, dracones duos duabus manibus necauit, quos Iuno miserat, unde primigenius est dictus." which translates to "When Hercules was an infant, he killed two serpents with his two hands, whom were sent by Iuno, from which he was named the first born." The passage is different from the statue because in the passage it says "dracones duos," "two snakes" but there is only one snake in the illustration. I think if there were to snakes in the illustratin it would display the power that Hercules has even from such a young age. Also, by looking at the illustration, you don't get as much information as the passage, which says that "quos Iuno miserat" so you would not know that the snakes were sent by Iuno.
