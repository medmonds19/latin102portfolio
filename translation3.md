Note: the verb sum, esse, fui, futurus has no present participle! If you want to construct the equivalent of a normal verbal unit using a participle with a noun, you can simply omit the verb “to be” and include the predicate (just as you can with finite forms of sum: Herculis fortis could be a complete sentence). This is most easily recognizable when the noun is an ablative in ablative absolute construction.

Vocabulary:

Augeas, Augeae (m), Augeas, king of Elis
bobile, bobilis (n), “stall”
caro, carnis (f), “flesh, meat”

Choose two choices of syntax, word order, or diction that Hyginus makes in this passage that complement or enhance the meaning of the passage’s content. Discuss briefly s in 3-4 sentences. Italicize Latin words when citing them.

One thing that is interesting in these passages is that Hercules' name is not mentioned, but infered as the subject. This is something we had to continue to remind ourselves in the breakout rooms when analyzing the Hyginus readings, because when you only look at a couple lines at a time, such as the ones above, you might forget that they are part of a much larger story, where Hercules is a prominent character, and his name may not be used in every sentence, but it can be inferred as the subject. 

Translation:

He cleaned the manure of the stall of King Augeas on one day, with greater part of help from Jupiter. He washed all of the manure away by letting the river in. 
He brought the bull, with whom Pasiphase had sex, from island Crete to Mycenae alive. 
With his slave Abderos he killed Diomenes, king of Thrace, and his four horses, who ate human flesh. The horses' names were Podargus, Lampon, Xanthus and Dinus.
